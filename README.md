# HTM-Spatial-Poler-Serialization-in-.NET--
This project implements a serialization technique for HTM Spatial Pooler Software module.

Hierarchical temporal memory (HTM) is a machine intelligence model which is inspired by the Neocortex and provides a framework to potentially perform learning and prediction of 
spatio temporal data.Spatial Pooler (SP) is an important component of HTM, that models how neurons learn from connections andmake an effective representation of input by converting
binary input patterns into Sparse Distributed Representations. Current implementation Spatial Pooler model does not support Serialization. This work analyses compatibility of a 
few Serialization techniques for Spatial Pooler and attempts to provide a best fit Serialization Model for the same.
